To launch scripts:

INSTALLATION:

Required Components:

1. NAnt   - Copy from Network location to C:\Dev\Tools\Nant\0.85
2. NUnit  - Copy from Network location to C:\Dev\Tools\NUnit\2.4
3. NCover - Copy from Network location to C:\Dev\Tools\NCover\1.5.8 

Setting up system path:

1. Add location of NAnt.exe to your system path.
2. Add MSBuild ( c:\winnt\microsoft.net\3.5.xxx\ to your system path.



CONFIGURATION AND SETTINGS:

1. Open command window and go to build directory c:\dev\commonlibrary.
   c:\dev\commonlibrary\build

2. The _commonlibrary.settings.xml file is used to store settings
   for building/versioning/deploying/etc your project.
   If you have the same settings ( location of source code for example )
   then you do not need to change this file.

   To change the file:
   Change the _commonlibrary.settings.xml file
   - If you have commonlibrary installed to a different location,
     you can make a copy of this _commonlibrary.settings.file,
     such as _commonlibrary.settings.local.xml
   - Change the locations of various paths in the settings file
     to coincide with where you stored your project
